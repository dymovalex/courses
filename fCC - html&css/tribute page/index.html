			<h2>Early life</h2>
			<p class="about">
			Tony Soprano was born in 1959, to Livia and Johnny Soprano. His father was a capo in the DiMeo crime family. He grew up living with his parents and two sisters, Janice and Barbara, in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. Tony's paternal grandfather, Corrado Soprano Sr., was from Ariano in the Province of Avellino who immigrated to the United States in 1911; he was a master stonemason who helped to build a church in Tony's old neighborhood.</p>
			<p class="about">
			In adulthood, Tony recalls how Johnny used Janice as a cover for attending meetings with criminal associates at a children's amusement park, leading him to assume she was his father's favorite child. In therapy, when asked to remember happy childhood memories about his mother, Tony struggles to come up with any; he later describes his mother as a cruel, joyless woman who wore his father down "to a little nub" and who seemed to delight in threatening her own children. Tony has a troubled relationship with Janice, due to her flighty and impulsive nature, which leads to her constantly relying on him for financial and emotional support. Their bond is further complicated in adulthood when she murders her boyfriend, Richie Aprile, one of Tony's subordinates, for striking her during a domestic dispute, leading to her calling on Tony for assistance in disposing of his body.</p>
			<p class="about">
			In high school, Tony met his future bride Carmela DeAngelis, and became friends with Artie Bucco and Davey Scatino. He was also close to his maternal cousin Tony Blundetto; their mutual relatives called them Tony-Uncle-Al and Tony-Uncle-Johnny (after their fathers) to tell them apart, although Tony and his friends would take to calling him "Tony B." The two Tonys spent summers at the farm of their uncle Pat Blundetto, a former DiMeo soldato (soldier) allowed to retire from the Mafia due to chronic illness. When they were in their early twenties, Tony B was arrested for his part in a hijacking: Tony was supposed to join Tony B on the job, but failed to appear because of a panic attack after an argument with his mother, which resulted in his blacking out and suffering a head injury. For years after, Tony claimed that he had sustained the injury during a mugging, a story he maintained in order to abate his survivor's guilt. As a young adult, he attended Seton Hall University for a semester and a half before dropping out to pursue a life of crime.</p>
			<p class="about">
			Tony was part of an unofficial crew of young criminals consisting of Silvio Dante, Ralph Cifaretto, and Jackie Aprile, Sr. He and Jackie gained notoriety in the DiMeo family by robbing a card game run by Feech La Manna; Ralph was left out of the plan due to debilitating pain from a venereal disease, leading to a lifelong animosity between the two. Under the tutelage of his father's friend Paulie "Walnuts" Gualtieri, he committed his first murder in 1982 at the age of 22, killing a small-time bookie named Willie Overall. Following the murder, Paulie would become Tony's mentor in the Mafia lifestyle, with Paulie eventually settling into a role as Tony's own capo.</p>
			<p class="about">
			Johnny shepherded Tony through his ascendancy until his death in 1986 from emphysema. When he died, Johnny had risen to the level of capo of his own crew, as had his older brother, Junior. Junior took over as Tony's mentor, with parental figures Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero and Paulie passing their loyalty to Tony upon Johnny's death, while Silvio joined the crew. Tony became acting capo of his father's old crew, a position which eventually became permanent.</p>
			<p class="about">
			By 1995, Jackie Aprile, Sr. became acting boss after Ercole "Eckley" DiMeo was sent to prison. The DiMeo family was prosperous under Jackie's rule until 1998, when he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. With Jackie in and out of the hospital, a power struggle develops between Tony and Junior. With Jackie's death in mid-1999, a succession crisis reaches a point where a war within the family appears imminent. However, Tony brings a quick end to the conflict by endorsing Junior the official boss of the family. Unbeknownst to Junior, Tony secretly strikes a deal with the rest of the family to be the true boss, allowing Junior to believe that he's in power and act as a distraction for the FBI. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Soprano" target="_blank">For more details, follow to Wiki</a></p>
